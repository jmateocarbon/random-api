<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Want to be updated in latest security news without getting to websites one by one? Here's a simple script to do just that.

### Built With

* [Python](https://www.python.org/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* Python
  ```sh
  Please use python version 3.5 >
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/jmateocarbon/random-api.git
   ```
2. Install python packages
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Both Scripts have an input function on the command line:

Virustotal.py scans infected URL

While HaveIbeenPwned checks for databreaches linked to a specified account

Notice there is a config.py file here, that is where you'd have to put your API Key
* [VirusTotal](https://developers.virustotal.com/reference)
* [HaveIbeenPwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v2)
